 # Clone App

This is a clone app of Instagram created using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Appwrite. Below is the documentation for the project.

## Features

- **Sign In**: Implemented a sign-in page to allow users to log in to the app using Appwrite authentication.
- **Sign Up**: Created a sign-up page to register new users with Appwrite authentication.
- **Storage**: Utilized Appwrite storage to handle image uploads and media storage.
- **Routing**: Implemented routing to navigate between different pages of the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Appwrite**: An open-source platform providing various backend services such as authentication, storage, and more.
